    abstract = { Why do so many joint ventures fail? Despite the fact that their success is the exception rather than the rule, the literature on why joint venture performance has been so poor remains fragmentary. We address this issue, adopting a transaction-cost economics perspective and modeling joint ventures as governance structures that blend the advantages and drawbacks of both markets and hierarchies. Using a data base on electronics industry ventures and event history analysis, we identify several predictors of joint venture failure and test for their influences. A key finding is that the presence of competition between joint venture partners outside of the agreement significantly impairs chances for the operation's chance of survival. We also find clear evidence that the failure rate of joint ventures is nonmonotonic, rising to a peak in the middle term and then declining. Finally, we compare and contrast predictors of terminations due to failure to those due to acquisition of the joint venture by one of its partners. Our overall conclusions highlight implications for strategic choice theory-building and the management of joint ventures. }

  abstract	= {This paper analyses a major episode in contemporary
		  biomedical research using a new semi-quantitative approach.
		  In the late 1970s, immunologists began producing new kinds
		  of antibodies targeting molecules on the surface of normal
		  and malignant blood cells. These tools quickly transformed
		  biomedical research in immunology and oncology-hematology.
		  Laboratories worldwide produced thousands of these new
		  reagents and reorganized the classification, diagnosis, and
		  prognosis of diseases such as leukemia and the lymphomas.
		  The rapid development of these reagents initially generated
		  considerable confusion. To avoid the impending chaos,
		  researchers in the field, officially supported by the World
		  Health Organization and the International Union of
		  Immunological Societies, launched an ongoing series of
		  distributed workshops that led to the establishment of a
		  nomenclature of antibody reagents and cell surface
		  molecules. The First Workshop (1981-82) mobilized 54
		  research groups from 14 countries and resulted in the
		  establishment of 15 antibody/molecule categories. By the
		  late 1990s the number of these categories had increased to
		  more than 247 and the number of participating laboratories
		  had risen to more than 500. Sociological analyses of this
		  kind of large-scale collaborative research usually adopt
		  one of two equally unsatisfactory alternatives: either they
		  provide thick descriptions of selected sites, thus missing
		  the figurational dimension of the collaborative network, or
		  they attempt to account for figurational complexity by
		  reducing it to a few quantitative indicators, thus
		  destroying for all practical purposes the very phenomena
		  under investigation. To avoid these two alternatives, we
		  opted for a combination of ethnographic methods
		  (interviews, content analysis) and a computer-based
		  analysis of the more than 6000 antibodies examined during
		  the first six workshops, using Réseau-Lu, a software
		  program specifically designed for the treatment of
		  heterogeneous relational data.},

  abstract	= {The apparent success of free/libre open source software
		  (FLOSS) development projects such as Linux, Apache, and
		  many others has raised the question, what lessons from
		  FLOSS development can be transferred to mainstream software
		  development? In this paper, we use coordination theory to
		  analyze coordination mechanisms in FLOSS development and
		  compare our analysis with existing literature on
		  coordination in proprietary software development. We
		  examined developer interaction data from three active and
		  successful FLOSS projects and used content analysis to
		  identify the coordination mechanisms used by the
		  participants. We found that there were similarities between
		  the FLOSS groups and the reported practices of the
		  proprietary project in the coordination mechanisms used to
		  manage task-task dependencies. However, we found clear
		  differences in the coordination mechanisms used to manage
		  task-actor dependencies. While published descriptions of
		  proprietary software development involved an elaborate
		  system to locate the developer who owned the relevant piece
		  of code, we found that
		  {\textquotedblleft}self-assignment{\textquotedblright} was
		  the most common mechanism across three FLOSS projects. This
		  coordination mechanism is consistent with expectations for
		  distributed and largely volunteer teams. We conclude by
		  discussing whether these emergent practices can be usefully
		  transferred to mainstream practice and indicating
		  directions for future research.},

  abstract	= {To provide evidence-based strategies for ensuring rigor of
		  case studies, the authors examine what rigor types authors
		  report and how they report them by content analyzing all
		  case studies published 1995–2000 in 10 management
		  journals. Comparing practices in articles addressing rigor
		  extensively and less extensively, the authors reveal three
		  strategies for insuring rigor. First, very few case study
		  authors explicitly label the rigor criteria in terms of the
		  concepts commonly used in the positivist tradition
		  (construct, internal, and external validity, as well as
		  reliability). Despite this, papers addressing rigor
		  extensively do report concrete research actions taken to
		  ensure methodological rigor. Second, papers addressing
		  rigor extensively prioritized rigor types: more, and more
		  detailed, strategies were reported for ensuring internal
		  and construct validity than for external validity. Third,
		  emergent strategies used in the field were reported, such
		  as setbacks and serendipities, that necessitated changes to
		  the originally planned research procedures. Authors focus
		  squarely on the concrete research actions taken, carefully
		  relaying them to the reader so that the reader may
		  appreciate the logic and purpose of trade-off decisions in
		  the context of the specific case study.},

               The engagement of firms in multiple simultaneous strategic alliances with different partners has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today’s business landscape. This article offers a review of the extant alliance portfolio literature and organizes it around three key research areas: (a) the emergence of alliance portfolios, (b) the configuration of alliance portfolios, and (c) the management of alliance portfolios. The article also highlights existing gaps in the present understanding of alliance portfolios and outlines a research agenda by identifying key research questions and issues in the areas where further research is needed.

abstract="The explosion of data available from online systems such as social media is creating a wealth of trace data, that is, data that record evidence of human activity. The volume of data available offers great potential to advance social and behavioural science research. However, the data are of a very different kind than more conventional social and behavioural science data, posing challenges to use. This paper adopts a data framework from Earth observation science and applies it to trace data to identify possible issues in analysing trace data. Application of the framework also reveals issues for sharing and reusing data.",

title="On rapid releases and software testing: a case study and a semi-systematic literature review",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2015",
volume="20",

pages="1384--1425",
abstract="Large open and closed source organizations like Google, Facebook and Mozilla are migrating their products towards rapid releases. While this allows faster time-to-market and user feedback, it also implies less time for testing and bug fixing. Since initial research results indeed show that rapid releases fix proportionally less reported bugs than traditional releases, this paper investigates the changes in software testing effort after moving to rapid releases in the context of a case study on Mozilla Firefox, and performs a semi-systematic literature review. The case study analyzes the results of 312,502 execution runs of the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test cases of Mozilla Firefox from 2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9 major rapid releases), and triangulates our findings with a Mozilla QA engineer. We find that rapid releases have a narrower test scope that enables a deeper investigation of the features and regressions with the highest risk. Furthermore, rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally smaller spikes before the main release. However, rapid releases make it more difficult to build a large testing community , and they decrease test suite diversity and make testing more deadline oriented. In addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits, problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases originated from several software development methodologies such as agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development. However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce.",

@Article{	  teixeira2015lessons,
  abstract	= {Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a
		  single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where
		  software is developed by a networked community of
		  individuals and organizations, which base their relations
		  to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent
		  research suggests that software development can actually be
		  jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known
		  that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept
		  collaborating in open source projects while running
		  expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study
		  approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the
		  open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that
		  combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) with
		  mining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network
		  Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes
		  within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to
		  Software Engineering research by exploring the role of
		  groups, sub-communities and business models within a
		  high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results
		  point out that competition for the same revenue model
		  (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not
		  necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem.
		  Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of
		  the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected
		  social tendency of developers to work with developers from
		  same firm (i.e., homophony) did not hold within the
		  OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel,
		  complex and unexplored open source case, this research also
		  contributes to the management literature in coopetition
		  strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich
		  description on how heterogeneous actors within a
		  high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups,
		  established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a
		  complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source
		  arena.},

However, the extent to which multilevel research is overtly practiced remains to be examined. This article analyzes 10 years of organizational research within a multilevel framework (from 2001 to 2011). The goals of this article are (a) to understand what has been done, during this decade, in the field of organizational multilevel research and (b) to suggest new arenas of research for the next decade. A total of 132 articles were selected for analysis through ISI Web of Knowledge. Through a broad-based literature review, results suggest that there is equilibrium between the amount of empirical and conceptual papers regarding multilevel research, with most studies addressing the cross-level dynamics between teams and individuals. In addition, this study also found that the time still has little presence in organizational multilevel research. Implications, limitations, and future directions are addressed in the end.},

abstract = "Understanding when entrants might have an advantage over an industry's incumbent firms in developing and adopting new technologies is a question which several scholars have explained in terms of technological capabilities or organizational dynamics. This paper proposes that the value network—the context within which a firm competes and solves customers' problems—is an important factor affecting whether incumbent or entrant firms will most successfully innovate. In a study of technology development in the disk drive industry, the authors found that incumbents led the industry in developing and adopting new technologies of every sort identified by earlier scholars —at component and architectural levels; competency-enhancing and competency-destroying; incremental and radical—as long as the technology addressed customers' needs within the value network in which the incumbents competed. Entrants led in developing and adopting technologies which addressed user needs in different, emerging value networks. It is in these innovations, which disrupted established trajectories of technological progress in established markets, that attackers proved to have an advantage. The rate of improvement in product performance which technologists provide may exceed the rate of improvement demanded in established markets. This mismatch between trajectories enables firms entering emerging value networks subsequently to attack the industry's established markets as well. "

The structural holes theory sees network ties as opportunities linking together separate network segments through brokers and weak ties. The opposing view argues that network closure would generate superior “social capital” and thus superior “economic rent” as we would have more trust, reputation and cooperation within a closed group with strong internal ties. We discuss these theories in the context of multilateral airline alliances and argue that the two concepts in combination advance our ability to explain alliance processes in the airline industry. "

Defying conventional wisdom on the negative effects of uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly reveal their innovations to competing users and to manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers are in a position to refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper, we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users’ decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings. "

 abstract = {The capabilities offered by digital communication are leading to the evolution of new network structures that are grounded in communication patterns. As these structures are significant for organizations, much research has been devoted to understanding network dynamics in ongoing processes of electronic communication. A valuable method for this objective is Social Network Analysis. However, its current focus on quantifying and interpreting aggregated static relationship structures suffers from some limitations for the domain of analyzing online communication with high volatility and massive exchange of timed messages. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method for event-based dynamic network visualization and analysis together with its exploratory social network intelligence software Commetrix. Based on longitudinal data of corporate email communication, the paper demonstrates how exploration of animated graphs combined with measuring temporal network changes identifies measurement artifacts of static network analysis, describes community formation processes and network lifecycles, bridges actor level with network level analysis by analyzing the structural impact of actor activities, and measures how network structures react to external events. The methods and findings improve our understanding of dynamic phenomena in online communication and motivate novel metrics that complement Social Network Analysis.},

year={2017},

pages={56-75},
abstract={Many open source and commercial developers practice contemporary code review, a lightweight, informal, tool-based code review process. To better understand this process and its benefits, we gathered information about code review practices via surveys of open source software developers and developers from Microsoft. The results of our analysis suggest that developers spend approximately 10-15 percent of their time in code reviews, with the amount of effort increasing with experience. Developers consider code review important, stating that in addition to finding defects, code reviews offer other benefits, including knowledge sharing, community building, and maintaining code quality. The quality of the code submitted for review helps reviewers form impressions about their teammates, which can influence future collaborations. We found a large amount of similarity between the Microsoft and OSS respondents. One interesting difference is that while OSS respondents view code review as an important method of impression formation, Microsoft respondents found knowledge dissemination to be more important. Finally, we found little difference between distributed and co-located Microsoft teams. Our findings identify the following key areas that warrant focused research: 1) exploring the non-technical benefits of code reviews, 2) helping developers in articulating review comments, and 3) assisting reviewers' program comprehension during code reviews.},
